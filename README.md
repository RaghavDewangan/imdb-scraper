Simple shell script that retrieves title, genre, year, rating, and plot of specified film using the OMDb API (Third party non affiliated) for scraping the details off of IMDb. 

The API returns a JSON formatted output that we must parse, hense the usage of "jq" which needs to be installed using: '$ sudo apt-get install jq'

Used comments to help understand script and what it does
